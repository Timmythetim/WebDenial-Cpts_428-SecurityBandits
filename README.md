# Web Denial Security Project

This project involves setting up a web server that is meant to be resiliant to DoS/DDoS attacks. Upon creation of this server, we will attack it and exploit vulnerabilities on it, which will then be met with a defense enhancement to prevent the vulnerabilities which were discovered.
